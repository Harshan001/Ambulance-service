# Ambulance-service
The Ambulance emergency service app is designed to have a variety of features. Booking an ambulance is now faster and hassle-free. In a situation, like the one demonstrated above, using this app to book your ambulance is more preferable than wasting crucial time by calling up the ambulance drivers individually.
     As we listened the word ‘Ambulance’ the first thing comes to mind is the rescue process. In the modern era where the population is increasing day by day, people feel uncomfortable and frightened due to danger aspects of road accidents, some known and unknown disease which required the quickly treatment but unfortunately due to couple of minute delay some important lives are lost. Therefore, to give the quick first-aid to the patient rescue system of every country should be maintained and trained well for the betterment of human beings and to avoid the deaths which occur due to delay in rescue process. So our first goal is to maintain the ambulance service system first by making android application for the rescue process. It will provide all the rescue centers to stand on one platform through ambulance service application. In case of any accident we call an ambulance for help via call. There are many organizations which provide ambulance services in Pakistan. But there is a problem with these organizations that they did not work together. So that, when there an accident occur people call for ambulance of specific organization   There can be possibility that the ambulance of that organization will not available near the place of accident. So this application will help people to find ambulance near them of any organization. We have proposed an android app namely ambulance emergency service(AES).
User will properly sign up in the app with his mobile and CNIC number for authentication so that irrelevant person will not use this app without any reason. In case of emergency he will request for an ambulance made from his phone that will be directly updated on a centralized main office where 24/7 server will automatically check his request, calculate coordinates and will check the availability of ambulance in very nearly station, if there is no ambulance available in that station, then server will check up next near station and response back to the user that request is in progress and how much time it takes to reach, and from which station. All this process and management will be handled virtually using defined algorithm. The whole history will maintain on server side.
